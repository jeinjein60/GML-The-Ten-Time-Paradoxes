The Ten Time Paradoxes is a 2D pixel art adventure game developed in GameMaker using GML. In this side project, youâ€™ll go through time and explore ten mysterious timelines in strange and exciting ways. Designed as a personal journey to dive deep into game development, this game showcases my learning in pixel art, game mechanics, and scripting with GameMaker Language (GML).
